# School District Analysis

## Project Overview 

  The purpose of this assignment was to replace the Thomas High School ninth graders' reading/math scores with NaNs to keep the complete data intact due to academic dishonesty. After this, we were to continue with the rest of the analysis like we did in the PyCitySchools notebook.

## Resources
Data Source - students_complete.csv,schools_complete.csv
Software - Python 3.9.5, conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- The district summary in the new analysis had a one percent decrease in the overall passing percentage from the original  scores.
- The percentages of the Thomas High School in the new school summary increased tremedously when the grades were replaced.The new analysis percentages resemble the numbers from the original analysis , when the ninth graders were included, which was the purpose of the assignment. The average reading and math scores stayed around the same number in the new and original analysis.

- Replacing the grades raised the grade percentages approximately 20 percent. 
### Ninth Grades Scores
- Math and reading scores, school spending, school size and school types did not differ from the orignial analysis. 
  
## Summary 

One of the main changes in the analysis was the increase in the passing and overall percentages when we replaced the numbers after using NaNs for the ninth graders. Initially, the overall percentage was at 65 percent, but when we updated the numbers, they returned to 90 percent. Another change was the district summary overall passing percentage. The percentage decreased by a percent, however, it's a minor change to the analysis. Replacing the numbers also brought the Thomas High School's overall passing percentage up to the second best school in the analysis. Finally, the passing math and reading percentages increased from the initial replacement of the ninth graders' grades and resemble the original analysis.
